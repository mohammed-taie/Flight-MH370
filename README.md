Flight MH370 Dataset
I collected this dataset during March to April 2014 from hundreds of websites that discussed Malaysia Airlines Flight (MH370) disappearance on March 8 2014. It contains 241 vertices and 1563 edges (excluding labels) forming the known relationships between the  passengers. It consists of three columns: Labels, Names (passengerâ€™s first and second names followed by age, although some passenger ages could not be known) and Connected-to.
